 Implement this delegate to be notified of picture uploads. Pictures are uploaded sequentially and stored using an internal Core Data scheme.
 Uploading takes place at the end of the call if any pictures were saved during the call and only in Agent mode. Uploading may take place upon
 SDK initialization if any picture were left from a previous call.
 
 No assumption to be made on the threads used to call any of the delegate's method.
