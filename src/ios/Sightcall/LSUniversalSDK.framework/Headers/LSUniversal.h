/**
 The LSUniversal object is your point of entry to the connection and call control. The Callflow is simplified to the max:

 - Start the connection using parameters;
 - When the connection goes active, the call is created;
 - When the call ends, you are disconnected.

 Starting can be done through two methods startWithDictionary: or startWithString: . The latter makes use of the former.

 The call internals are controlled through the UI (turning off the camera, muting the mic. etc). As said before, the call is started upon connection.

 You are notified of the connection state through the delegate property. You can check the status of the connection anytime by calling currentConnectionStatus.

 You can call abort during connection or during a call. It will either directly disconnect the LSUniversalSDK or hangup the call, which will in turn disconnect the LSUniversalSDK. On your end, calls can be ended either trough this abort method or the hangup button in the call view UI. You are notified of call ends by the [LSUniversalDelegate callReport:].
 
 Upon init, the self.mobile2mobile instance is initialized and attemps to sign in if agent credentials are available.
