Cordova Plugin SightCall
========================

Cordova Plugin for SightCall.

##	Â Installation

- Add this to config.xml

```
	<plugin name="cordova-plugin-sightcall" spec="https://github.com/okode/cordova-plugin-sightcall.git">
	    <variable name="MICROPHONE_USAGE_DESCRIPTION" value="Used for videocalls" />
	    <variable name="UNIVERSAL_FEATURE_DEEPLINK_URI" value="@string/universal_feature_deeplink_uri" />
	</plugin>
```

- Add this to package.json below your dependencies section

```
	"cordova-plugin-sightcall": "git+https://github.com/okode/cordova-plugin-sightcall.git"
```

- Add this to package.json below your cordova/plugins section

```
	"cordova-plugin-sightcall": {
		"MICROPHONE_USAGE_DESCRIPTION": "Used for videocalls",
		"UNIVERSAL_FEATURE_DEEPLINK_URI": "@string/universal_feature_deeplink_uri"
	}
```

- Register a custom application Firebase Messaging service (only on Android if you have a notification broker that uses Firebase Cloud Messaging).

    If you are using a push notification broker which uses Firebase Messaging service, you will must have a custom application one that broadcasts Firebase events to the differents Messaging services.

    For example, consider an application that uses both Urban Airship's SDK and Sightcall's SDK. Both libraries register their own Firebase Messaging services so that the registered one with the highest priority at manifest will work but the another one won't. As a result, some push notification library could stop working on Android if you install this plugin. To fix this unexpected behaviour, you must register a custom application Firebase Messagin service like that:

	- Add this to config.xml in order to add you custom service to your Android project and register it in AndroidManifest.xml with high priority.

	```
        <resource-file src="resources/android/urban_sightcall_integration/CustomFcmListenerService.java" target="src/com/mapfre/reparadores/CustomFcmListenerService.java" />
        <custom-config-file target="AndroidManifest.xml" parent="./application">
            <service android:enabled="@bool/universal_feature_fcm" android:exported="false" android:name="com.mapfre.reparadores.CustomFcmListenerService">
                <intent-filter android:priority="9999">
                    <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
                </intent-filter>
            </service>
        </custom-config-file>
    ```
